Task 1 â€“ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This was my first task in the Elevate AI/ML Internship. I worked with the Titanic dataset and focused on cleaning the data so it could be used for analysis or modeling.

What I did:
- Identified missing values in the dataset
- Filled missing age values using the median
- Dropped the 'Cabin' column due to too many missing values
- Filled missing 'Embarked' entries using the most common value
- Converted categorical data into numeric format using one-hot encoding
- Scaled numeric features like Age and Fare

Tools used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Outcome:
I prepared a clean, organized dataset ready for machine learning tasks. This step is important because models perform better on clean, well-structured data.
